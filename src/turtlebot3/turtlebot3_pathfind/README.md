The following package is the code for Assignment 3 of ELEC230 at the University of Liverpool.

The original code was developed by Daniel McGuiness for ROS. The package was then updated and refactored for ROS2 by David Batty (@DavidBatty95) 

The C++ programs that enable the simulated TurtleBot3 model: Burger to run on Gazebo & the real robot were modified by Gideon Tladi (sggtladi@liverpool.ac.uk).
